 Neural Networks and Deep Learning Code for mnist
 ====
## 1.Introdution
This is how I use different optimization methods to improve the recognition accuracy of the network's mnist.

## 2.Requirements
* python3
* pycharm
* numpy so on

## 3.Running demos
Change test.py based on what you tested and run it directly

## Creditsï¼š
  I refer to many fantastic repos during the implementation:
